X create red cube
X create arbitrary 3d structure from array
X snap sphere to snap points
X compute snap points from structure
X snap sphere to any face of structure
X use closest snap point
X point cone in the direction of normal
X compute normal of snap points
X point cone in direction of snap point normal

---------------------------------------------------- later
don't create internal faces
place z range on snap (no long jumps)
use closest snap point as plane center (don't hide piece)

place axle on cell (four sided)
place door on axle cell
place end-point on door cell
place pulley on ground
place motor on ground
connect line from door to motor through pulley
activate and release motor
add spring between door and support

create falling red cube
create ground
reboot physics



---------------------------------------------------- done
