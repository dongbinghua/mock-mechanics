X join pulley and anchor
X create correct part models
X reboot cable creation

reboot mouse force
create/delete point and hinge constraints
make sure mouse force attaches at surface

---------------------------------------------------- later
store cable length after finished
enforce cable constraints
create part menu
show that part is selected
create part properties pane (color, dimensions)
create sliding part (snap to cable, can be snapped to)
create winding part (snap to cable and change cable size when rotated)
recompute cable lenght after moving its parts
grid islands
create pulley model
create hinge model
create anchor model
create motor part
create button part
create spring part
create video feature
"think mechanically"
control motor with square wave
challenges
small cube edges inside larger cube

don't allow double cable between anchors
parameterize snap point distance (placement and cable)
pan and rotate in wire mode
snap to floating pulley
use cable algorithm to create electrical wires
don't snap if there is collision
don't snap anchors to axles, etc
set color of any part
create bounding boxes for parts (faster picking)
program motor and buttons manually for now
draw guide snap points
create prefab object
place z limit on snap (no long jumps)
activate and release motor
add spring between door and support
publish on steam
