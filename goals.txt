X attach cube to grid
X better name
X pick base of object
X snap base of object
X create part structure
X draw parts
X implement get-part-at
X get all cube faces
X test with cone
X attach cube to other cubes
X attach axle to cube
X attach cube to axle
X panning
X draw line between two points (thin cylinder)

create modes
connect line between anchors
pass line through pulleys
create modes buttons (move, interact, wire)

snap to floating pulley
remove paired snap points
create falling red cube
create ground
reboot physics
create point and hinge constraints
toggle interact and build


---------------------------------------------------- later
don't pick cable
set color of any part
create bounding boxes for parts (faster picking)
grid islands
create pulley model
create hinge model
create anchor model
attach motor
attach button
program motor and buttons manually for now
draw guide points
don't snap if there is collision
create prefab object
place z range on snap (no long jumps)
activate and release motor
add spring between door and support

---------------------------------------------------- done

X create red cube
X create arbitrary 3d structure from array
X snap sphere to snap points
X compute snap points from structure
X snap sphere to any face of structure
X use closest snap point
X point cone in the direction of normal
X compute normal of snap points
X point cone in direction of snap point normal
